<h1 align="center">Project 5: Khmer Text Prediction </h1>

# Khmer Text Prediction System 🇰🇭

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Khmer Text Prediction System** that predicts the next word or suggests possible words as a user types in Khmer.  
The system investigates both **statistical** and **deep learning** approaches and addresses key challenges in Khmer language processing such as **word spacing ambiguity**, **compound word structures**, and **orthographic variants**.

This project is designed as an **academic / thesis-level project**, combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a Khmer text prediction model for next-word suggestion
- Compare traditional and deep learning language models
- Analyze challenges in Khmer language prediction
- Develop a simple demo (auto-suggestion or sentence completion)
- Evaluate prediction accuracy and relevance

---

## 🧠 Models Investigated
The following language modeling approaches are implemented and compared:

### 1. Statistical Models
- Unigram Model
- Bigram Model
- Trigram Model
- N-gram with Laplace / Kneser–Ney smoothing

### 2. Deep Learning Models
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

### 3. Transformer-Based Models
- GPT-style language models
- Multilingual BERT (mBERT)
- Multilingual T5 (mT5)

## 📚 Dataset
Khmer text corpus collected from multiple sources:
- Online Khmer news websites
- Social media text (public posts/comments)
- Khmer literature and articles

> ⚠️ Note: All datasets are used strictly for **academic research purposes**.

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps include:
- Text normalization
- Sentence segmentation
- Khmer word tokenization
- Handling spacing ambiguity
- Vocabulary construction
- Sequence generation for language modeling

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated using:
- Prediction Accuracy
- Perplexity
- Top-K accuracy
- Qualitative relevance analysis (human evaluation)

---

## 💻 Demo Application
A simple demonstration is implemented:
- Keyboard-style auto-suggestion
- Next-word prediction
- Sentence completion

The demo allows users to type Khmer text and receive real-time word suggestions.
